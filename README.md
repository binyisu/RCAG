Residual Channel-wise Attention Gate   If this code is helpful to you, please cite this paper "Event-based High frame-rate video reconstruction with a novel Cycle-Event Network ", thank you very much.
Code is accomplished by keras 2.24.
We give a video example of urban dataset. noted that Stacking Based on Time （SBT） makes the texture information of some event frames insufficient, thus this video not presents the best result. Increasing the time interval of stacking is a good way to increase the textural information of event frames.
